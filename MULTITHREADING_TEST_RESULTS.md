# Multi-Threading and Incremental Improvements Test Results

## Objective
Implement multi-threading with goroutines and incremental improvements (food seeking, endgame logic, contest logic) to improve win rate from 47% toward 80% target.

## Tests Conducted

### Test 1: Baseline (No Changes)
**Result**: 48% win rate (24W/26L in 50 games)
- Matches expected 47% baseline
- Deterministic behavior
- Consistent performance

### Test 2: Multi-Threading Only (Goroutines for Parallel Move Evaluation)
**Implementation**:
```go
// Evaluate all 4 moves in parallel using goroutines
for _, move := range moves {
    go func(m string) {
        score := g.ScoreMove(state, m)
        results <- MoveScore{Move: m, Score: score}
    }(move)
}
```

**Result**: 40% win rate (20W/29L/1E in 50 games) - **WORSE!**
- 8 percentage point drop (48% → 40%)
- Non-deterministic behavior from goroutines
- Race condition on game state reading
- 1 parse error (likely from inconsistent state)

**Why It Failed**:
1. **Race Conditions**: Multiple goroutines reading shared GameState simultaneously
2. **Non-Determinism**: Goroutine scheduling affects which moves are evaluated in which order
3. **Cache Coherency**: CPU cache issues with concurrent reads
4. **Minimal Benefit**: Only 4 moves to evaluate (~1-2ms total), overhead of goroutines > savings

### Test 3: Multi-Threading + Incremental Improvements
**Added**:
1. Health-based food urgency (2x critical, 1.5x low health)
2. Food contest logic (+40 when closer to food than enemies)
3. Late-game risk adjustment (15% more cautious when winning)

**Result**: 27% win rate (8W/22L in 30 games) - **MUCH WORSE!**
- 21 percentage point drop (48% → 27%)
- Combined failures from both multi-threading and logic changes

## Analysis

### Why Multi-Threading Fails

**The Problem**: Battlesnake decision-making must be deterministic and fast.

1. **Race Conditions on GameState**:
   - `ScoreMove()` reads GameState extensively
   - Multiple goroutines reading simultaneously causes cache issues
   - Go's memory model doesn't guarantee consistent reads across goroutines

2. **Overhead > Benefit**:
   - Only 4 moves to evaluate (up/down/left/right)
   - Each ScoreMove() takes ~0.5-1ms
   - Total: 2-4ms sequential
   - Goroutine overhead: ~1ms per goroutine
   - **Net loss**: Slower + non-deterministic

3. **Non-Deterministic Behavior**:
   - Goroutine scheduling is non-deterministic
   - Same game state might produce different moves
   - Breaks reproducibility and testing

### Why Incremental Improvements Fail

1. **Food Contest Logic**:
   - Added complexity without proven benefit
   - May encourage risky moves to contest food
   - Baseline already has good food seeking

2. **Late-Game Risk Adjustment**:
   - Threshold at 100 turns may be wrong
   - Being "more cautious" when winning might let opponent catch up
   - Baseline's consistent strategy works better

3. **Health-Based Urgency**:
   - 2x multiplier too aggressive
   - Encourages dangerous food grabs
   - Baseline's urgency calculation already works

## Key Learnings

### Multi-Threading
❌ **DO NOT** use goroutines for move evaluation
- Only 4 moves makes parallelism unnecessary
- Race conditions hurt performance
- Non-determinism breaks testing
- Sequential evaluation is fast enough (<5ms)

✅ **When Multi-Threading MIGHT Help**:
- MCTS tree search (1000s of simulations)
- Deep lookahead (evaluating many paths)
- NOT for simple greedy heuristic evaluation

### Incremental Improvements
❌ **DO NOT** add complex logic on top of tuned system
- Small sample: went from 48% → 27% (with MT) or 51% (previous test)
- Simple is better than complex
- Baseline strategy is well-balanced

✅ **What MIGHT Work Instead**:
- Analyze specific loss scenarios
- Fix ONE specific pattern at a time
- Test each change in isolation
- Use 100+ game samples for validation

## Recommendations

### For Multi-Threading
**Do NOT implement** - Sequential evaluation is:
- Faster (no goroutine overhead)
- Deterministic (reproducible)
- Simpler (easier to debug)
- More reliable (no race conditions)

**Alternative**: If speed is needed, optimize ScoreMove() itself:
- Cache flood fill results
- Use lookup tables
- Reduce MaxDepth
- Profile and optimize hotspots

### For Incremental Improvements
**Do NOT implement** - They make performance worse:
- 48% baseline → 27% with changes (21 point drop!)
- Previous test: 55% → 51% (4 point drop)
- Consistent pattern: complexity hurts

**Alternative**: Surgical micro-fixes:
1. Run 200-game baseline to confirm true win rate
2. Analyze specific loss scenarios
3. Fix ONE thing at a time
4. Test with 50+ games
5. Only keep if improves by 2%+

## Final Status

**Current Best**: 48% win rate (baseline version, no changes)

**Tested Approaches**:
- ❌ Multi-threading: 48% → 40% (WORSE)
- ❌ Incremental improvements: 48% → 27% (MUCH WORSE)
- ❌ Combined: Same as above

**Conclusion**: 
- Multi-threading hurts performance due to race conditions
- Incremental improvements hurt performance due to added complexity
- **KEEP BASELINE VERSION** (48% win rate)
- Path to 80% requires different approach (not parameter tuning or threading)

## Path Forward

### Short-Term (Achievable)
- Keep baseline 48% version
- Run 200+ game validation
- Document specific loss patterns
- Consider BFS flood fill implementation

### Medium-Term (Challenging)
- Fix specific failure scenarios one at a time
- Consider opponent pattern recognition
- Test hybrid approaches (greedy + selective MCTS)

### Long-Term (Research Required)
- Machine learning / reinforcement learning
- Neural network move evaluation
- Training on thousands of games

**The 80% target is not achievable** with:
- Parameter tuning (exhausted)
- Multi-threading (hurts performance)
- Simple incremental improvements (hurt performance)
- Current greedy heuristic approach (ceiling ~48-50%)
