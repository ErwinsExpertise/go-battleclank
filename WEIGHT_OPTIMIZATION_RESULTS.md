# Weight Optimization Results

## Executive Summary

Performed systematic weight optimization testing 16 different configurations across 630+ games. **Best performance: 40% win rate** with baseline weights. Target of 80% win rate not achieved through weight tuning alone.

## Test Results

### Initial Optimization (30 games per config)
Tested 8 configurations:

| Configuration | Win Rate | Notes |
|--------------|----------|-------|
| **Baseline** | 40.0% | Best performer |
| Aggressive Space | 36.7% | Increased space weight to 350 |
| Food Focused | 36.7% | Reduced penalties, increased space |
| Less Conservative | 33.3% | Trap/dead end multipliers: 0.3 |
| Survival Focused | 33.3% | Higher penalties (0.6) |
| Deep Search | 33.3% | MaxDepth increased to 45 |
| Balanced | 30.0% | Moderate increases across board |
| Ultra Aggressive | 30.0% | High space (380), high center (18) |

### Fine-Tuning (50 games per config)
Tested 8 variations around baseline:

| Configuration | Win Rate | Record | Key Changes |
|--------------|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Baseline** | 38.0% | 19W/29L | Reference configuration |
| Moderate Penalties | 36.0% | 18W/29L | Multipliers: 0.35 |
| Space + Low Penalties | 36.0% | 18W/31L | Space: 320, multipliers: 0.3 |
| Minimal Penalties | 36.0% | 18W/29L | Multipliers: 0.15 |
| Low Penalties | 34.0% | 17W/31L | Multipliers: 0.2 |
| High Space | 34.0% | 17W/30L | Space: 320, multipliers: 0.4 |
| Lower Head Collision | 34.0% | 17W/31L | Head: 500 instead of 600 |
| Deep + Moderate | 32.0% | 16W/33L | Depth: 40, multipliers: 0.4 |

### BFS Flood Fill Test (100 games)
- **Result**: 26% win rate (26W/73L/1E)
- **Conclusion**: Recursive flood fill with depth limiting performs better than BFS
- Change reverted

## Key Findings

### What Works
1. **Baseline weights are optimal** among tested configurations
   - SpaceWeight: 250
   - HeadCollisionWeight: 600
   - CenterWeight: 10
   - WallPenaltyWeight: 150
   - CutoffWeight: 350
   - MaxDepth: 35
   - TrapMultiplier: 0.5
   - DeadEndMultiplier: 0.5

2. **Trap/dead end penalties at 0.5 multiplier** are correct
   - Reducing penalties (0.15-0.35) decreased performance
   - Increasing penalties (0.6) also decreased performance

3. **Recursive flood fill is better** than BFS for this use case
   - BFS dropped performance from 38% to 26%

### What Doesn't Work
1. **Increasing space weight** (320-380) didn't help
2. **Reducing head collision penalty** made it worse
3. **Deeper search** (40-45) decreased performance
4. **Aggressive center control** (15-18) didn't help

## Analysis

### Why 38% Ceiling?

The consistent ~35-40% win rate across all reasonable configurations suggests:

1. **Strategic Gap**: Not a weight tuning issue but a fundamental strategic difference
2. **Information Asymmetry**: The baseline may be using information/patterns we don't detect
3. **Behavioral Differences**: The baseline Rust snake may have game-specific logic not captured in weights

### The 40% Win Rate vs Issue Description

The issue states "performing better against the baseline" which suggests it was worse before. Our current 38-40% may already be an improvement from an earlier state.

## Recommendations

### Short Term (To Reach 60%)
1. **Game Log Analysis**: Run games with detailed logging to understand:
   - Common death patterns
   - Positions where we lose
   - Baseline's successful moves vs our moves
   
2. **Behavior Analysis**: Compare move-by-move decisions:
   - Why does baseline choose certain moves?
   - What situations cause our losses?
   - Are there specific board states where we fail?

3. **A-Star Tuning**: The food seeking uses A-star with MaxAStarNodes=400
   - Test different values (200, 300, 600)
   - May affect food competition

### Medium Term (To Reach 80%)
1. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify if baseline uses:
   - Specific opening strategies
   - Food control patterns
   - Territory control methods

2. **Custom Logic for Baseline**: Add specific counters:
   - If baseline exhibits patterns, counter them
   - Dynamic strategy switching based on opponent behavior

3. **Machine Learning**: Use the benchmark infrastructure for:
   - Reinforcement learning to discover better strategies
   - Genetic algorithms for weight evolution (would need 1000s of games)

### Long Term
1. **MCTS Implementation**: The codebase has `mcts.go` - try Monte Carlo Tree Search
2. **Opponent Modeling**: Build a model of baseline's decision-making
3. **Ensemble Strategies**: Combine multiple approaches

## Conclusion

**Weight tuning alone cannot achieve 80% win rate.** The current 38-40% represents optimal weight configuration. Further improvement requires:

1. Understanding WHY we lose (game log analysis)
2. Identifying baseline's strategic advantages
3. Implementing targeted counters or fundamentally different approaches

The gap from 40% to 80% is substantial and suggests we need strategic changes, not just parameter tuning.
