# Failure Analysis Summary - 100 Game Test

## Test Results (Latest Run)

**Win Rate**: 32% (32 wins / 65 losses / 3 errors)  
**Date**: 2025-11-01  

## Key Findings

### Death Timing Breakdown

| Phase | Count | Percentage | Turns Range |
|-------|-------|------------|-------------|
| **Mid-game** | 34 | 52.3% | 50-150 turns |
| **Late-game** | 25 | 38.5% | 150-300 turns |
| **Early-game** | 5 | 7.7% | 0-50 turns |
| **Very late** | 1 | 1.5% | 300+ turns |

### Turn Statistics for Losses
- **Average**: 141.3 turns
- **Minimum**: 27 turns (very early death)
- **Maximum**: 311 turns (lasted very long)

## Pattern Analysis

### 1. Mid-Game Deaths (52.3% - CRITICAL ISSUE)
**Problem**: Majority of losses occur in the 50-150 turn range

**Likely Causes**:
- Food control issues - losing food competitions
- Trap avoidance too aggressive - avoiding safe food
- Not aggressive enough in contesting food
- Poor space management leading to getting boxed in

**Recommendations**:
- Reduce trap penalty multipliers (currently 0.5, try 0.3-0.4)
- Increase food seeking aggressiveness
- Better food competition logic

### 2. Late-Game Deaths (38.5% - COMPETITIVE)
**Problem**: Losing close matches in 150-300 turn range

**Likely Causes**:
- Endgame tactical errors
- Not capitalizing on advantages
- Baseline executes better in tight spaces

**Recommendations**:
- MCTS could help with tactical planning
- Better endgame strategy
- These are winnable games with better tactics

### 3. Early-Game Deaths (7.7% - MINOR ISSUE)
**Problem**: Only 5 games died early (before turn 50)

**Status**: Not a major concern, but worth reviewing opening strategy

### 4. Very Late Games (1.5% - RARE)
Only 1 game lasted beyond 300 turns - shows we can compete in long games

## Actionable Recommendations

### High Priority (Should Improve Mid-Game)
1. **Reduce Trap Penalties** 
   ```python
   # Test: Trap multiplier from 0.5 → 0.35
   # Test: Dead-end multiplier from 0.5 → 0.35
   ```

2. **Increase Food Aggressiveness**
   ```python
   # Test: Increase food weights by 20%
   # Test: Reduce food danger penalties
   ```

3. **Test MCTS for Mid-Game**
   - MCTS excels at tactical decision-making
   - Should help with food competition and trap navigation
   - Expected improvement: +10-15%

### Medium Priority (Should Improve Late-Game)
1. **Lookahead Search**
   - Better multi-turn planning for endgame
   - Expected improvement: +5-10%

2. **Phase-Specific Strategy**
   ```go
   if state.Turn < 100 {
       // Mid-game: Aggressive food control
       foodWeight *= 1.3
       trapPenalty *= 0.7
   } else {
       // Late-game: Conservative, tactical
       // Use MCTS or lookahead
   }
   ```

### Testing Plan

#### Phase 1: Quick Wins (Reduce Mid-Game Deaths)
1. Test trap penalty 0.35 (30 games) - **Expected: 35-40% win rate**
2. Test food aggressiveness +20% (30 games) - **Expected: 35-38% win rate**
3. Test combined (50 games) - **Expected: 38-42% win rate**

#### Phase 2: Strategic Improvements (Improve Tactics)
1. Test MCTS 100 iterations (50 games) - **Expected: 45-55% win rate**
2. Test MCTS 200 iterations (50 games) - **Expected: 50-60% win rate**
3. Test Lookahead depth 3 (50 games) - **Expected: 40-50% win rate**

#### Phase 3: Combination Approach
1. Best greedy config + MCTS for critical moments
2. Phase-specific strategies
3. **Target: 70-80% win rate**

## Expected Outcomes

### Conservative Estimate
- Trap/food tuning: +5-8% (37-40% total)
- MCTS implementation: +15-20% (52-58% total)
- Phase optimization: +5-10% (57-68% total)
- **Total: 60-68% win rate**

### Optimistic Estimate
- Trap/food tuning: +8-10% (40-42% total)
- Strong MCTS performance: +20-25% (60-67% total)
- Phase optimization: +10-15% (70-80% total)
- **Total: 75-85% win rate - ACHIEVES TARGET**

## Conclusion

The 32% baseline with mid-game death concentration provides a clear improvement path:

1. **Quick fixes**: Reduce trap penalties, increase food aggression → 38-42%
2. **MCTS**: Better tactical planning for mid/late game → 50-60%
3. **Optimization**: Phase-specific tuning → **70-80% TARGET**

The path to 80% is achievable through systematic application of these improvements, focusing on mid-game food control and tactical decision-making.
