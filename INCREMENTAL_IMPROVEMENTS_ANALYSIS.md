# Incremental Improvements Analysis

## Objective
Implement Option 1 improvements to push from 55% to 80% win rate:
1. Food seeking improvements (+5-8%)
2. Endgame specialization (+3-5%)
3. Multi-turn tactics (+5-10%)

## Improvements Attempted

### 1. Enhanced Food Seeking with Contest Logic
**Implementation**:
- `evaluateFoodContestSituation()`: Bonus for food when enemies nearby
- Encourages competing for food against opponents
- Boosts food priority when closer to food than enemy
- +30 points if bigger and closer, +15 if smaller but closer, +10 to steal

**Health-based Urgency**:
- Critical (health < 20): 2.5x boost  
- Low (health < 40): 1.8x boost
- Aggressive (aggression > 0.6): 1.3x boost

### 2. Endgame Specialization
**Implementation**:
- `evaluateEndgameStrategy()`: Adjusts risk tolerance based on game state
- Late game (150+ turns): evaluate position
- **Winning + Late** (200+ turns): 1.3x more cautious (survive)
- **Losing + Late** (150+ turns): 0.7x less cautious (take risks)
- Competitive: normal behavior

### 3. Multi-turn Tactics
**Implementation**:
- `evaluateMultiTurnEscape()`: 2-move lookahead for escape routes
- Checks if current path leads to better positions
- +100 if future space improves significantly (>20%)
- +50 if future space improves
- -100 if future space gets much worse (<30%)

### 4. Helper Functions
- `getNextPosition()`: Calculate next position from move
- `isPositionSafe()`: Check if position avoids collision

## Test Results

| Version | Win Rate | Change | Notes |
|---------|----------|--------|-------|
| Baseline Matched | 55% | - | Pure baseline weights |
| With All Improvements | 51% | **-4%** | **Worse!** |
| 10% More Aggressive Pursuit | 50% | -5% | Slightly worse |

## Analysis - Why Improvements Failed

### Root Cause: Added Complexity Hurt Performance

1. **Food Contest Logic Issues**:
   - Multi-turn calculation is expensive (O(n²) for 2 moves ahead)
   - May have caused timeouts or slower decisions
   - Contest logic might be too aggressive in wrong situations

2. **Endgame Specialization Problems**:
   - The 150-turn threshold may be wrong (games average 140 turns)
   - Being "too cautious" when winning might let opponent catch up
   - Being "too aggressive" when losing might cause early deaths

3. **Multi-turn Escape Complexity**:
   - Checking 4 directions × 4 directions = 16 flood fills per move
   - Very expensive computationally
   - May timeout or slow down decision making
   - Baseline uses simple 1-move lookahead (-200 penalty)

4. **Performance Regression**:
   - Even the "clean" baseline version now tests at 48-50%
   - Suggests environmental factors or random variance
   - Original 55% test may have been fortunate variance

## Key Learnings

### What Didn't Work
1. **Complex multi-turn lookahead** - Too expensive
2. **Contest logic for food** - May be too aggressive
3. **Endgame risk adjustment** - Wrong thresholds or logic
4. **Adding features on top of tuned system** - Disrupts balance

### What Might Work Instead

1. **Simpler Improvements**:
   - Just boost pursuit by 5-10% (not 10%, maybe 5%)
   - Slightly increase food weight when health < 30
   - Don't add new complex calculations

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Cache flood fill results
   - Reduce MaxDepth from 121 to 100
   - Use lookup tables instead of calculations

3. **Focused Fixes**:
   - Analyze the 45% of losses
   - Fix specific failure patterns
   - Don't add general "improvements"

4. **Alternative Approaches**:
   - Test with faster MCTS (reduced iterations)
   - Use hybrid: greedy + MCTS only in critical situations
   - Opponent pattern recognition (learn baseline's weaknesses)

## Recommendation

**DO NOT** add the incremental improvements - they make performance worse!

**Instead**:
1. Keep the 55% baseline-matched version
2. Run 500-game test to get accurate baseline (account for variance)
3. Analyze specific loss scenarios
4. Make targeted micro-fixes (single bonuses, not complex logic)
5. Test each change in isolation

## Statistical Note

Win rates fluctuate ±5% due to randomness:
- 55% with 100 games has ±10% confidence interval
- Need 500+ games for reliable measurement
- Our "55%" might actually be 50-60% true rate
- The "51%" result might just be normal variance

**Action**: Run larger sample size before making more changes.
