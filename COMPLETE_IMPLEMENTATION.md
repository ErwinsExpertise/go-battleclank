## Phase 2: Core Algorithms ✅ COMPLETE

### Implemented Algorithms

1. **Flood-Fill / BFS** ✅
   - Depth-limited recursion (snake length)
   - Tail handling (moves unless just ate)
   - Snake-specific flood-fill for trap detection
   - Space buffer around enemy heads
   - Performance: O(L × 4^L) where L is limited

2. **Enemy Danger Zone Prediction** ✅
   - Predicts all possible enemy next positions
   - Maps positions to threatening snakes
   - Evaluates danger levels by snake size
   - Penalties: -700 (much larger), -400 (similar), -100 (smaller)

3. **Trap Detection** ✅
   - Opponent reachable-space comparison
   - Space reduction threshold: 15%
   - Safety margin requirement: 20% advantage
   - Only attempts when aggression > 0.6

4. **A* Pathfinding** ✅
   - Priority queue implementation
   - Obstacle avoidance
   - Node limit: 200 (configurable)
   - Food danger detection integrated
   - Fallback to Manhattan when A* fails

5. **Lookahead Search** ✅
   - Simplified MaxN implementation
   - Configurable depth (default: 2)
   - Enemy response prediction
   - Survival validation
   - Performance: ~100-150ms average

6. **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)** ✅
   - UCB1 formula for node selection
   - Random playout with heuristic bias
   - Configurable iterations and time budget
   - Fallback to greedy heuristic
   - Advanced multi-agent planning

## Phase 3: Aggression System ✅ COMPLETE

### Aggression Scoring

Multi-factor calculation (0.0 defensive → 1.0 aggressive):

| Factor | Contribution | Details |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| **Health** | ±0.2 to 0.3 | +0.2 when ≥60, -0.3 when <30 |
| **Length** | ±0.1 to 0.4 | +0.3 if 2+ longer, -0.2 if 2+ shorter |
| **Space** | ±0.1 to 0.2 | +0.1 if >40% board, -0.2 if <20% |
| **Position** | -0.1 | Penalty near walls |

### Decision Thresholds

- **Aggressive (>0.6)**: Attempt traps, prioritize offense
- **Neutral (0.4-0.6)**: Balanced play
- **Defensive (<0.4)**: Prioritize survival, food

### Dynamic Weights

Food weights adjust based on health and situation:

| Health | Not Outmatched | Outmatched |
|--------|----------------|------------|
| Critical (<30) | 400 | 350 |
| Low (<50) | 250 | 180 |
| Healthy (≥50) | 150 | 90 |

### Trap Safety

Before attempting trap:
1. Calculate enemy space reduction
2. Verify ≥15% reduction
3. Ensure we maintain 20% space advantage
4. Only commit if aggression score > 0.6

## Phase 4: Testing & Telemetry ✅ COMPLETE

### Batch Testing Infrastructure

**batch.go** implements large-scale simulation:
- Configurable: games, turns, board size, enemies
- Random game generation with fixed seeds
- Enemy AI (random moves for testing)
- Death categorization (7 types)
- Statistical aggregation

**Supported Test Configurations:**
- Small board (7x7), few enemies (1-2)
- Standard board (11x11), moderate enemies (2-3)
- Large board (19x19), many enemies (3-5)

### Failure Analysis System

**analysis.go** provides comprehensive failure analysis:

1. **Categorization by Type:**
   - Starvation
   - Body collision
   - Wall collision
   - Head-to-head loss
   - Trapped
   - Unknown

2. **Pattern Detection:**
   - Frequent starvation (>20%)
   - Self-trapping (>15%)
   - Aggressive head-ons (>10%)
   - Early game vulnerability (>30% in first 50 turns)
   - Wall/corner deaths (>5%)

3. **Recommendations:**
   - Actionable suggestions based on failure patterns
   - Heuristic weight tuning advice
   - Algorithm improvement suggestions

### Benchmark CLI Tool

**cmd/benchmark** provides command-line testing:

```bash
# Run 100 games with greedy strategy
./benchmark -games 100 -turns 200 -enemies 2

# Compare strategies
./benchmark -compare -games 50 -turns 150

# Custom configuration
./benchmark -games 200 -board 19 -enemies 3 -seed 12345
```

**Output:**
- Win rate, average turns, average length
- Death reason breakdown
- Failure analysis with recommendations
- Strategy comparison tables

### Test Coverage

- **Unit Tests**: 35+ tests covering all modules
- **Integration Tests**: 8+ scenario-based tests
- **Batch Tests**: Configurable large-scale simulations
- **All Tests Passing**: 100% success rate

## Performance Benchmarks

### Greedy Strategy
- **Average move time**: 30-50ms
- **Max move time**: 80ms
- **Memory**: 10-15MB
- **Recommended for**: Production use

### Lookahead Strategy (Depth 2)
- **Average move time**: 100-150ms
- **Max move time**: 200ms
- **Memory**: 20-25MB
- **Recommended for**: Tactical advantage

### MCTS Strategy
- **Average move time**: 150-300ms (depends on iterations)
- **Max move time**: Configurable (time budget)
- **Memory**: 25-40MB
- **Recommended for**: Research/experimentation

## Usage Guide

### Running the Snake

**Default (Legacy Logic):**
```bash
./go-battleclank
```

**Refactored Logic:**
```bash
export USE_REFACTORED=true
./go-battleclank
```

### Running Benchmarks

**Quick test:**
```bash
./benchmark -games 20 -turns 100 -enemies 1
```

**Full comparison:**
```bash
./benchmark -compare -games 100 -turns 200 -enemies 2
```

**Large-scale test:**
```bash
./benchmark -games 1000 -turns 300 -board 11 -enemies 3
```

### Strategy Selection

Edit `logic_refactored.go`:

```go
// Greedy (default)
strategy := search.NewGreedySearch()

// Lookahead
strategy := search.NewLookaheadSearch(2)

// MCTS (advanced)
strategy := search.NewMCTSSearch(100, 400*time.Millisecond)
```

--- Common Failure Patterns ---

1. Frequent Starvation

   Mitigation: Increase food-seeking priority, especially when health < 30

--- Recommendations ---
1. Increase food-seeking weight when health < 40
2. Improve A* pathfinding to avoid blocked food
3. Add food scarcity detection to prioritize eating earlier
