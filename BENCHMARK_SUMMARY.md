# Live Benchmark Summary

## Executive Summary

**Current Status**: 35-38% win rate against actual Rust baseline snake (BELOW 80% target)

**Key Finding**: Our simulated tests (96% win rate) do NOT represent real-world performance. The simulated enemies use much simpler logic than the actual baseline.

## Test Results

### Initial Baseline (Original Code)
- **Win Rate**: 35% (35 wins / 62 losses / 3 errors out of 100 games)
- **Test Method**: Live games using battlesnake CLI against actual Rust baseline

### After Implementing Ratio-Based Trap Detection
- **Win Rate**: 33-38% (multiple test runs)
- **Changes Made**:
  - Ratio-based trap detection (40%, 60%, 80% thresholds)
  - Food death trap detection (70% threshold)
  - One-move lookahead
- **Result**: No significant improvement

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why Simulations Don't Match Reality

1. **Simulated Enemy**: Uses basic greedy/random logic
2. **Actual Baseline**: Implements sophisticated trap detection, lookahead, and survival strategies
3. **Gap**: Simulated tests showed 96% win rate, but real performance is 35%

### What We Tried

1. ✅ Implemented ratio-based trap detection
2. ✅ Implemented food death trap detection  
3. ✅ Implemented one-move lookahead
4. ❌ No significant improvement in win rate

### Why These Changes Didn't Help

The new trap detection features added penalties but didn't address the fundamental strategic gaps:
- Our snake may be too conservative OR too aggressive in certain situations
- The baseline may have better food control strategies
- The baseline may have better head-to-head decision-making
- Our flood fill implementation (recursive with depth limit) vs baseline (BFS) may produce different results

## Recommendations for Reaching 80% Win Rate

### Short-term (Highest Impact)

1. **Implement BFS Flood Fill**: Replace recursive flood fill with iterative BFS
   - More accurate space calculations
   - Matches baseline implementation
   - Likely to improve trap detection accuracy

2. **Tune Aggression Levels**: Analyze failure cases to determine if we're:
   - Too passive (letting baseline control board)
   - Too aggressive (taking unnecessary risks)

3. **Improve Food Control**: Better food seeking strategies
   - Contest food more aggressively when we have size advantage
   - Better food priority when multiple options exist

### Medium-term  

1. **Analyze Actual Game Logs**: Run games with detailed logging to understand:
   - Where/how we die most often
   - What moves led to losses
   - Pattern recognition in failure cases

2. **A/B Testing**: Test specific weight changes:
   - Food seeking weights
   - Space evaluation weights  
   - Danger zone penalties

### Long-term

1. **Machine Learning**: Use reinforcement learning to optimize weights
2. **Monte Carlo Tree Search**: For better tactical planning
3. **Opponent Modeling**: Learn baseline patterns and counter them

## Infrastructure Delivered

✅ **Live Benchmark System**
- Python script (`tools/run_benchmark.py`) that runs real games
- Proper Rust baseline build infrastructure (`baseline/Cargo.toml`)
- Automated win rate calculation
- Easy to run: `python3 tools/run_benchmark.py 100`

✅ **Analysis Documentation**
- `BASELINE_ANALYSIS.md`: Detailed analysis of baseline Rust snake
- `LIVE_BENCHMARK_ANALYSIS.md`: Implementation strategy
- This document: Summary of findings

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Implement BFS flood fill to match baseline accuracy
2. **Then**: Run 100-game benchmark to measure impact
3. **Iterate**: Continue tuning until 80% achieved

## Testing Command

```bash
# Run 100-game benchmark
cd /home/runner/work/go-battleclank/go-battleclank
python3 tools/run_benchmark.py 100
```

## Conclusion

The 80% win rate target is achievable but requires:
1. More accurate space evaluation (BFS flood fill)
2. Better strategic tuning based on actual game analysis
3. Iterative testing and refinement

The infrastructure is in place to test and validate changes quickly.
