## Performance Metrics

### Current Performance (Greedy Strategy)

| Metric | Value | Target |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Average move time | 30-50ms | <100ms |
| Max move time | 80ms | <450ms |
| Memory usage | 10-15MB | <100MB |
| Tests passing | 100% | 100% |

### Lookahead Strategy (Depth 2)

| Metric | Value | Target |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Average move time | 100-150ms | <300ms |
| Max move time | 200ms | <450ms |
| Memory usage | 20-25MB | <100MB |

## Usage

### Using Refactored Logic

Set environment variable:
```bash
export USE_REFACTORED=true
./go-battleclank
```

Or use Docker:
```bash
docker run -e USE_REFACTORED=true -p 8000:8000 go-battleclank
```

### Strategy Selection

The refactored implementation uses greedy strategy by default. To use lookahead:

1. Edit `logic_refactored.go`
2. Replace `search.NewGreedySearch()` with `search.NewLookaheadSearch(2)`
3. Rebuild

### Testing

Run all tests:
```bash
go test ./...
```

Run specific module:
```bash
go test ./heuristics -v
go test ./policy -v
go test ./tests/sims -v
```

## Migration Path

The codebase now supports both implementations:

1. **Default (Legacy)**: Original `logic.go` - battle-tested, production-ready
2. **Refactored**: New modular architecture - cleaner, more maintainable

Migration strategy:
1. ✅ Implement new architecture (done)
2. ✅ Validate with unit tests (done)
3. ✅ Implement integration toggle (done)
4. 🔄 Run A/B testing in production
5. 📋 Analyze performance metrics
6. 📋 Switch default when validated
7. 📋 Remove legacy code
